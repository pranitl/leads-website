## Why xeriscaping is surging now

With extreme heat events and water restrictions becoming the norm, xeriscaping offers a path to lower upkeep, bold curb appeal, and long-term savings.

## Cost ranges at a glance

Most single-family projects fall between **$8K and $35K**. Budgets shift based on grading corrections, irrigation retrofits, material choices, and permitting.

| Scope | Typical Range |
| --- | --- |
| Front yard refresh | $8,000 – $14,000 |
| Full property rebuild | $22,000 – $35,000 |
| Add-on boulder + lighting package | $4,200 – $8,800 |

## Savings tips

- Reuse on-site gravel or flagstone where possible.
- Bundle smart irrigation upgrades with planting to capture utility rebates.
- Book installs in late fall to secure offseason labor rates.
