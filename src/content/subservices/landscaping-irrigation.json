      "q": "Why is my water bill so high?",
      "a": "Often it's due to unseen leaks or inefficient spray heads that mist water into the air. A system audit can identify these waste points immediately."

    {
      "q": "Is drip irrigation better than sprinklers?",
      "a": "For planting beds, yes. Installers use drip to deliver water directly to the roots with 90%+ efficiency. Rotors are still best for large turf areas."
