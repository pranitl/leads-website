If you want a **"rustic, homey, local"** feel that builds trust for home services (hardscaping, closets, planting), you need to move away from this "dark mode" aesthetic.

Here is exactly how to pivot this high-converting layout into your "Austin Reno Hub" brand without making it look like a cold factory.

### The Diagnosis: Why the Current Design Misses
1. **Too Dark & Cold:** The deep forest green is elegant, but it feels "premium tech," not "accessible local handyman."
2. **Too Digital:** The abstract vector illustrations (the charts and graphs in the bottom left) mean nothing to a homeowner wanting a closet installed.
3. **Too Flat:** The white form floating on green lacks the tactile, physical quality of the "Hudson Lumber" inspiration.

### The Fix: "Vintage Hardware Store" Aesthetic
We will keep the **structure** (because the layout is good for conversion) but completely change the **skin**.

#### 1. The Background (Warmth over Coolness)
* **Current:** Dark Green (`#0F3D3E` approx).
* **Change to:** **Truck Cream (`#F2E8D5`)**.
* **Why:** A light, warm background feels like parchment or a painted wall. It is instantly more inviting and easier to read. It makes the page feel like a local flyer or a well-lit workshop, not a dark room.

#### 2. The Form (The "Job Ticket" Look)
Instead of a floating digital card, make the lead form look like a physical estimate clipboard or a job ticket.
* **Background:** White or very light beige.
* **Border:** Add a **3px solid Brown (`#5C4033`)** border.
* **Shadow:** Use the "hard shadow" we discussed (`4px 4px 0px #5C4033`).
* **Effect:** This makes the form pop off the page like a physical object asking to be filled out.

#### 3. Typography (Character over Cleanliness)
* **Headline:** Swap the generic sans-serif for **Hudson NY** or **Oswald (Bold)** in the **Oxide Red (`#BC4B38`)**.
 * *Copy Change:* "Your concierge for niche landscaping..." is okay, but purely visual. Try: **"We Build Austin's Best Backyards & Interiors."**
* **Body Text:** Keep a clean sans-serif (Lato), but make it **Dark Brown**, not Black or White.

#### 4. Imagery (Real Work, Not Abstract Art)
* **The Problem:** The screenshot shows abstract charts/graphs. This confuses customers.
* **The Fix:** You need a hero image or a collage of **High-Res Photos** of your actual niches:
 * A perfectly organized custom closet.
 * A xeriscaped front yard with native Texas plants.
 * A stone patio in Dripping Springs.
* **Styling:** Put these photos in frames with the same "hard" borders to make them look like Polaroids or portfolio prints.

### Detailed Design Specs for the "Rustic/Homey" Landing Page

Here is the blueprint for your designer or developer to follow:

**A. Header Section**
* **Background:** The "Truck Cream" (#F2E8D5).
* **Logo:** "Austin Reno Hub" in the heavy vintage font (Dark Brown).
* **Nav Links:** Simple text, widely spaced.

**B. Hero Section (The Money Maker)**
* **Layout:** Split 50/50 (Text Left, Form Right).
* **Headline:** "Trusted Local Pros for Hardscapes, Closets & Xeriscaping." (Font: Vintage Display, Color: Oxide Red).
* **Sub-headline:** "Serving Austin, Cedar Park, Leander & Dripping Springs." (Font: Lato, Color: Dark Brown).
* **The "Trust" Badge:** A seal graphic that says "Texas Native Plants Specialist" or "Local & Insured."

**C. The Form (Right Side)**
* **Header:** "Get Your Free Project Estimate."
* **Button:** **Oxide Red** background, "GET MY QUOTE" in cream text.
 * *Crucial Detail:* Add a small icon on the button (like a wrench or arrow).

**D. Trust Section (Below the Fold)**
* Instead of floating "glass" cards (like the screenshot), use **Kraft Paper texture** backgrounds for testimonials.
* Use a subtle "wood grain" or "recycled paper" texture overlay on the section backgrounds to kill the sterile digital feel.

### Summary
To avoid the "Industrial" vibe but keep the "Rustic" vibe:
1. **Avoid:** Grey concrete textures, gunmetal greys, diamond plate textures.
2. **Use:** Warm creams, matte paper textures, wood accents, and warm reds/browns.

This will make your site feel like a friendly, established local business that has been in Austin for 50 years, rather than a startup that just launched yesterday.
